# Automated Image Captioning with Custom Data Generator

## Overview
The **Automated Image Captioning** project utilizes deep learning to generate descriptive captions for images. By combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence generation, the model learns to generate meaningful captions for given images.

## Features
- Custom dataset support with a data generator
- CNN-based feature extraction
- LSTM-based caption generation
- Model evaluation using BLEU scores
- Real-time image captioning

## Installation
Clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar0930/Automated-Image-Captioning-with-Custom-Data-Generator.git
cd Automated-Image-Captioning-with-Custom-Data-Generator
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images paired with corresponding captions. The custom data generator preprocesses the images and tokenizes the captions, enabling efficient training.

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (image resizing, text tokenization).
2. Extract image features using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50).
3. Train an LSTM-based model for caption generation.
4. Evaluate the model using BLEU scores.
5. Deploy the model for real-time image captioning.

## Results
The model achieved the following evaluation scores:
- **BLEU-1:** 72.5%
- **BLEU-2:** 61.3%
- **BLEU-3:** 50.8%
- **BLEU-4:** 42.1%

These results indicate that the model generates relevant and meaningful captions. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the architecture and using larger datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
