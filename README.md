# Automated-Image-Captioning-with-Custom-Data-Generator
This project implements an automated image captioning system using deep learning. A custom data generator preprocesses image-caption pairs, handles batching, shuffling, and sequence conversion. The system trains a neural network to generate descriptive captions for images, enhancing image understanding and description tasks.
